## 🎮 About Me  
I am a game developer who specialises in Unity. More specifically, I am passionate about level design and the small mechanics in games. I love the attention to detail that goes into games and how it helps immerse the player in the game’s world, and I want to be part of the reason this can happen. 

First-class Computer Science graduate from the University of Plymouth with a strong foundation in 3D game development using Unity and a deep passion for technology and interactive media. Currently expanding my skills into Unreal Engine 5 and eager to explore diverse game development tools and styles. Seeking opportunities to contribute to creative and technically challenging projects while preparing to pursue a master’s degree in Games Development.

I am always willing to learn and adapt to new technologies and environments. I quickly become passionate about what I am working on and enjoy the journey it takes me on. I am hardworking and thrive in team settings. I am always excited to start something new and see it through to the end, where I can appreciate the final product.
