# 👋 Hi, I'm Morgan Hodge  

## 🎮 About Me  
I am a game developer who specialises in Unity. More specifically, I am passionate about level design and the small mechanics in games. I love the attention to detail that goes into games and how it helps immerse the player in the game’s world, and I want to be part of the reason this can happen. 

First-class Computer Science graduate from the University of Plymouth with a strong foundation in 3D game development using Unity and a deep passion for technology and interactive media. Currently expanding my skills into Unreal Engine 5 and eager to explore diverse game development tools and styles. Seeking opportunities to contribute to creative and technically challenging projects while preparing to pursue a master’s degree in Games Development.

I am always willing to learn and adapt to new technologies and environments. I quickly become passionate about what I am working on and enjoy the journey it takes me on. I am hardworking and thrive in team settings. I am always excited to start something new and see it through to the end, where I can appreciate the final product.

By the time I graduate, I want to have a fully completed portfolio website, showcasing my polished version of Timeline Takedown (my final year project) along with other projects I have worked on. 

My goal is to find a game development job as soon as I finish university. I don’t have a preference for a specific company—I just want to start working, gaining real-world experience, and growing as a developer. 

In the future, once I have industry experience, I want to move outside of England to work in different places and experience new cultures. While I am eager to leave England, I believe it would be smarter to stay here for the first few years of my career to gain work experience. I think securing my first job will be much easier here than in a different country.
