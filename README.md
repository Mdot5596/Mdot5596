# 👋 Hi, I'm Morgan Hodge  

## 🎮 About Me  
I am a game developer who specialises in Unity. More specifically, I am passionate about level design and the small mechanics in games. I love the attention to detail that goes into games and how it helps immerse the player in the game’s world, and I want to be part of the reason this can happen. 

Most of my experience has been in 3D games using Unity, I am keen to learn and try out new game engines and different game styles. 

- 🔹 Currently working on: **TimeLine Takedown**  
- 🎓 Final Year Student at **University of Plynouth**  
- 🌱 Exploring **OpenGL Shading, Unity 5, UnrealEngine**  
- 🌍 Aspiring to work internationally in the future  

I am always willing to learn and adapt to new technologies and environments. I quickly become passionate about what I am working on and enjoy the journey it takes me on. I am hardworking and thrive in team settings. I am always excited to start something new and see it through to the end, where I can appreciate the final product. 

## 🛠️ Skills  
**Game Development:** Unity, C#
**Graphics & Shaders:** OpenGL, GLSL, Shader Graph  
**Tools & Tech:** Git, GitHub, Blender, Figma, Website Dev
**Other:** Agile Development, Game Design Principles  

Right now, I am working on a 3D FPS wave-based shooter in Unity for my final year project. I am the sole developer for this project, and you can find more details on my Itch.io page. 

Alongside this, I am working on my OpenGL shading module, where I am creating scenes that utilize different shading and lighting features. You can find more about this in my GitHub repository here. 

I am also actively engaging with the industry by attending events and working to find my place in the game development field. 

## 🚀 Projects  
🔹 **[TimeLine Takedown]** - ([https://morganhodge.itch.io/timeline-takedown](#))  
🔹 **[Guard Duty]** -  ([https://guard-duty.itch.io/guard-duty](#))  
🔹 **[Cyber Gladiator OpenGL 2D Game]** - ([https://github.com/Mdot5596/CyberGladiator](#))  
🔹 **[Zombie OpenGL Scene]** -  ([https://github.com/Mdot5596/Zombie-Scene-OpenGL)](#))  


By the time I graduate, I want to have a fully completed portfolio website, showcasing my polished version of Timeline Takedown (my final year project) along with other projects I have worked on. 

My goal is to find a game development job as soon as I finish university. I don’t have a preference for a specific company—I just want to start working, gaining real-world experience, and growing as a developer. 

In the future, once I have industry experience, I want to move outside of England to work in different places and experience new cultures. While I am eager to leave England, I believe it would be smarter to stay here for the first few years of my career to gain work experience. I think securing my first job will be much easier here than in a different country.
